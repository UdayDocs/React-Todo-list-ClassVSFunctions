## Implementation Insights: Class Components vs Function Components ‚öõÔ∏è

This project demonstrates both React component paradigms. Here's a comparative overview of their usage:

| **Aspect**               | **Class Components**                     | **Function Components**           |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **State Management**      | `this.state` + `setState()`              | `useState()` hook                 |
| **Lifecycle Methods**     | `componentDidMount()`/`Update()`/etc     | `useEffect()` hook                |
| **Syntax**                | ES6 class with `render()` method         | Arrow/function return JSX directly|
| **Complexity**            | More boilerplate code                    | Concete, linear code flow         |
| **Error Boundaries**      | Supported via class methods              | Not natively supported            |
| **This Binding**          | Requires method binding                  | No binding needed                 |

### Why Both Paradigms Are Shown:
1. **Class Component Implementation**  
   - Demonstrates legacy React patterns
   - Shows lifecycle method usage
   - Illustrates state management without hooks

2. **Function Component Implementation**  
   - Modern React best practices
   - Highlights hooks adoption (`useState`, `useEffect`)
   - Demonstrates cleaner component structure
